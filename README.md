# C-Advance

These are the advanced C knowledge that I learned in the 2nd semester of my 2nd year at university.

Knowledge of advanced sorting, programming generalization, reb black tree (with jval, field, jrb), b-tree, graph, huffman, data compression, traversal and search functions.

The knowledge is spread from week 1 to week 14, with practice test questions, libraries are saved at each week, test also have their own library.
